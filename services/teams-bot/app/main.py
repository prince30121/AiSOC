"""
FastAPI entrypoint for the AiSOC Teams bot.

The Teams bot is intentionally smaller than the Slack bot today: it
ships exactly one webhook (``/teams/messages``) that consumes the Bot
Framework activity for an Adaptive Card ``invoke`` and dispatches it
through :func:`app.callbacks.handle_card_action`.

We keep the surface small for two reasons:

* the **only Teams-specific T3.6 contract** is "render an Adaptive Card
  approval prompt and verify the signed callback that comes back" —
  every upstream call lands in ``services/actions`` exactly as it does
  for Slack;
* the **Bot Framework outer auth** (JWT in the Authorization header
  signed by Microsoft) is enforced by the deployment fronting reverse
  proxy, not by this service. The bot itself never minted or holds the
  Microsoft secret. Our HMAC signature on the card payload is a
  *defence in depth* sitting inside their envelope, and is the surface
  we control end-to-end.
