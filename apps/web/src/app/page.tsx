/**
 * AiSOC root (`/`) — onboarding-first landing page (WS-A2).
 *
 * The plan asks the root to be an onboarding surface, not a marketing page:
 * three CTAs (Try the demo / Connect first source / Skip & explore) live
 * above the fold, with platform context (features, architecture, MITRE,
 * open-source pitch) reused below for visitors who want to read more before
 * clicking. The legacy hero/CTA strip is intentionally retired — buyers
 * shouldn't have to choose between "open the demo" and "open console" without
 * context. The new hero collapses both into a single primary path.
